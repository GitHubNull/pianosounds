#Piano Sounds
Need piano sounds? This should help you!

I have resampled a range of raw piano sounds from the University of IOWA Electronic Music Studios (http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html).

I did this using SoX and Cygwin on Windows, and I have included the download and generation scripts in case you are interested, or want to resample yourself using different settings. Or sample another instrument from the UIOWA website.

Have fun!
